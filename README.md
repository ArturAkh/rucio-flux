# Rucio


We have two clusters: integration and production.
The end goal is to leverage Flux and Kustomize to manage both clusters while minimizing duplicated declarations.

We will configure Flux to install, test and upgrade Rucio using
`HelmRepository` and `HelmRelease` custom resources.
Flux will monitor the Helm repository, and it will automatically
upgrade the Helm releases to their latest chart version based on semver ranges.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Kubernetes cluster version 1.16 or newer and kubectl version 1.18.
For a quick local test, you can use [Kubernetes kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
Any other Kubernetes setup will work as well though.

In order to follow the guide you'll need a GitHub account and a
[personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
that can create repositories (check all permissions under `repo`).


Or install the CLI by downloading precompiled binaries using a Bash script:

```sh
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following top directories:

- **apps** dir contains Helm releases with a custom configuration per cluster
- **infrastructure** dir contains common infra tools such as NGINX ingress controller and Helm repository definitions
- **clusters** dir contains the Flux configuration per cluster

```
├── apps
│   ├── base
│   ├── production 
│   └── integration
├── infrastructure
│   ├── prometheus
│   ├── [etc]
└── clusters
    ├── production
    └── integration
```

The apps configuration is structured into:

- **apps/base/** dir contains namespaces and Helm release definitions
- **apps/production/** dir contains the production Helm release values
- **apps/integration/** dir contains the staging values


Note that with `path: ./apps/staging` we configure Flux to sync the staging Kustomize overlay and 
with `dependsOn` we tell Flux to create the infrastructure items before deploying the apps.

Fork this repository on your personal GitHub account and export your GitHub access token, username and repo name:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
export GITHUB_REPO=<repository-name>
```

Verify that your staging cluster satisfies the prerequisites with:

```sh
flux check --pre
```

Set the kubectl context to your staging cluster and bootstrap Flux:

```sh
flux bootstrap github \
    --owner=${GITHUB_USER} \
    --repository=${GITHUB_REPO} \
    --branch=main \
    --personal \
    --path=clusters/integration
```

The bootstrap command commits the manifests for the Flux components in `clusters/staging/flux-system` dir
and creates a deploy key with read-only access on GitHub, so it can pull changes inside the cluster.

Watch for the Helm releases being install on staging:

```console
$ watch flux get helmreleases --all-namespaces 
NAMESPACE	NAME   	REVISION	SUSPENDED	READY	MESSAGE                          
nginx    	nginx  	5.6.14  	False    	True 	release reconciliation succeeded	
podinfo  	podinfo	5.0.3   	False    	True 	release reconciliation succeeded	
redis    	redis  	11.3.4  	False    	True 	release reconciliation succeeded
```



Watch the production reconciliation:

```console
$ watch flux get kustomizations
NAME          	REVISION                                        READY
apps          	main/797cd90cc8e81feb30cfe471a5186b86daf2758d	True
flux-system   	main/797cd90cc8e81feb30cfe471a5186b86daf2758d	True
infrastructure	main/797cd90cc8e81feb30cfe471a5186b86daf2758d	True
```


## Testing

Any change to the Kubernetes manifests or to the repository structure should be validated in CI before
a pull requests is merged into the main branch and synced on the cluster.

This repository contains the following GitHub CI workflows:

* the [test](./.github/workflows/test.yaml) workflow validates the Kubernetes manifests and Kustomize overlays with kubeval
* the [e2e](./.github/workflows/e2e.yaml) workflow starts a Kubernetes cluster in CI and tests the staging setup by running Flux in Kubernetes Kind
